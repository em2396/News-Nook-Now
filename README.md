## 📚 Learning Goals
- Use the technology you’ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:


## 🥇 Wins
⭐ Successfully integrating react and an API
⭐ I am proud of the styling and search functionality
⭐ The more I practice creating react apps, the more comfortable I become with them. I know it takes time and practice.


## 🚧 Challenges
❗ I really struggled with the search functionality. There was a weird error I couldn't fix. My solution was to essentially duplicate components that were doing the same thing to get the searched articles to display
❗ I was surprised by the amount of time it took me to complete this project. Sometimes overcoming a bug isn't planned and it adds a lot of time to your expected time.
❗ Only having 100 api calls/day can make it challenging when you switch from using sample data and come across a different error you weren't expecting.
